    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi my name is Paul I am a 37 year old husband and father of 3. Currently I work as a driver for a waste company where I have been employed for nearly 15 years. I would relly love to learn web development as a new skill to potentially do some freelance work in the future, or even persue a whole new career path
        entirely. Over the last couple of years i have been putting an increasing amount of effort into self improvement physically. Now I feel it is time for mental gains.
    </p>
    <h3>My hobbies include:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Working out</li>
    <li>Jump rope</li>
    <li>Walking</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>Spending as much time on adventures with the family as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately my biggest personal achievement is my weight loss, which I achieved with hard work, discipline and improving my knowledge</p>
